`vn-utils` is a collection of general-purpose utility traits and structures used across the link:../readme.asciidoc[VN-Suit] workspace.

----

The crate is organized into several modules, each providing a specific category of utilities.

=== Core Modules

* **cache**: Provides caching mechanisms (e.g., `TimedLRUCache`) for managing resources with expiration policies.
* **float**: Trait `NaNTo` for safe handling of NaN values in floating-point calculations.
* **result**: Trait `MonoResult` for simplifying results where `Ok` and `Err` share the same type.
* **string**: Utilities for character-index based string manipulation (`InsertAtCharIndex`, `RemoveAtCharIndex`).
* **option**: A trait extending `UpdateOption` with convenient update methods for Options.

=== Design Decisions

* **Minimal Dependencies**: The crate aims to have as few dependencies as possible to keep it lightweight.
* **Trait-Based Extensions**: Focuses on extending standard library types via traits to provide more ergonomic APIs.

== TODO

- [ ] Logging Utilities: Standardized logging macros or wrappers.
- [ ] Math Utilities: Common 2D/3D math functions (e.g., lerp, clamp for non-float types).
- [ ] Profiling Macros: Simple timing and profiling tools.
